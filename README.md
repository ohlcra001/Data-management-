Data management and tidying for Honours Project
1) My final stiched Rmarkdown is supplied as an HTML document in the repository where I provide both the R code used to tidy the data as well as an explanation for each chunk of code and a visual graph for an output 
2) The RAW data can be found in the Data folder 
3) The original Rmarkdown and its code can be found in the Code folder
4) No output folder was added as the output itself can be found in the stiched R Markdown.
